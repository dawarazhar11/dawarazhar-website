## 💻 Code & Technical Examples

### Code Block Standards
```python
# Always specify the language for syntax highlighting
# Include necessary imports at the top
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def calculate_reynolds_number(velocity, length, kinematic_viscosity):
    """
    Calculate Reynolds number for flow analysis.
    
    Args:
        velocity (float): Flow velocity in m/s
        length (float): Characteristic length in m
        kinematic_viscosity (float): Kinematic viscosity in m²/s
    
    Returns:
        float: Reynolds number (dimensionless)
    """
    return velocity * length / kinematic_viscosity

# Example usage with realistic values
Re = calculate_reynolds_number(10.0, 0.1, 1.5e-5)  # Re ≈ 66,667
print(f"Reynolds number: {Re:.0f}")
```

### Mathematical Expressions
- Use LaTeX notation for complex equations when supported
- Explain all variables and their units
- Include dimensional analysis where applicable
- Example: Reynolds number Re = ρvL/μ, where ρ is density, v is velocity, L is characteristic length, μ is dynamic viscosity

### Equation Formatting
```markdown
The Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow are:

**Continuity equation:**
∇ · **v** = 0

**Momentum equation:**
ρ(∂**v**/∂t + **v** · ∇**v**) = -∇p + μ∇²**v** + **f**

Where:
- **v** = velocity vector (m/s)
- ρ = fluid density (kg/m³)
- p = pressure (Pa)
- μ = dynamic viscosity (Pa·s)
- **f** = body force per unit volume (N/m³)
```
