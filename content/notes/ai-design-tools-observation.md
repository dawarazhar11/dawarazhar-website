Watching the rapid evolution of AI-assisted engineering tools. Fusion 360's generative design is impressive, but I'm more excited about AI for simulation setup.

Imagine describing a flow problem in natural language: "Model airflow around a car at highway speeds with crosswind" and having the AI set up geometry, mesh, boundary conditions, and solver settings.

We're probably 2-3 years away from this being reliable. The challenge isn't the AI—it's encoding decades of engineering judgment into training data.

Still skeptical about AI replacing engineers, but excited about AI amplifying engineering productivity. 🤖
