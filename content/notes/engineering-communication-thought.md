Had a presentation today where I explained CFD results to a mixed audience—engineers, managers, and clients. The challenge wasn't the technical content; it was choosing the right level of detail for each group.

Engineers wanted Reynolds numbers and turbulence models. Managers wanted timeline impacts. Clients wanted reassurance about performance.

Same simulation, three different stories. All accurate, all necessary.

Technical communication isn't about dumbing down—it's about translation. Good engineers are also good translators. 🗣️

Planning to write more about this. Engineering success depends as much on communication as on calculation.
