  "fullDescription": "This flagship project focused on developing a solid-state transformer (SST) capable of replacing traditional line-frequency transformers while adding advanced grid support functionalities. The SST enables bidirectional power flow, voltage regulation, and reactive power compensation.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe SST employs a three-stage architecture:\n1. AC-DC rectifier stage with active front-end\n2. Isolated DC-DC converter with high-frequency transformer\n3. DC-AC inverter stage for load-side voltage synthesis\n\n## Innovation Highlights\n\n- Custom-designed high-frequency transformer operating at 20kHz\n- Dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter for galvanic isolation\n- Advanced thermal management using liquid cooling\n- Grid-forming inverter capability for microgrid applications\n\n## Performance Metrics\n\nThe prototype demonstrated excellent performance across various operating conditions, including unity power factor operation, voltage sag compensation, and seamless transition between grid-connected and islanded modes.",
