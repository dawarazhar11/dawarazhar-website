  "fullDescription": "This project encompassed the full development cycle of a 350kW DC fast charging station, from initial concept through to production-ready design. The charger supports both CCS and CHAdeMO standards with liquid-cooled cables.\n\n## System Architecture\n\n### Power Conversion\n- Three-phase Vienna rectifier front-end\n- Interleaved LLC resonant converter\n- Wide output voltage range: 200-1000V DC\n\n### Mechanical Design\n- IP54-rated outdoor enclosure\n- Forced air cooling with redundant fans\n- Cable management system\n- User interface with 15\" touchscreen\n\n## Safety and Compliance\n\nThe design meets all relevant standards including:\n- IEC 61851-23 (DC charging)\n- UL 2202 (EV charging equipment)\n- ISO 15118 (V2G communication)\n\n## Production Engineering\n\nDesign for manufacturing (DFM) principles were applied throughout, resulting in a modular architecture that simplifies assembly and enables field serviceability.",
