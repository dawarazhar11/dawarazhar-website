  "fullDescription": "Thermal management is critical for achieving high power density in modern power electronics. This project developed an advanced liquid cooling solution capable of dissipating heat fluxes up to 200W/cm2 while maintaining junction temperatures within safe operating limits.\n\n## Design Approach\n\n### CFD-Driven Optimization\nExtensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed to optimize the cold plate geometry, including:\n- Microchannel configurations\n- Pin-fin arrays\n- Jet impingement zones\n\n### Thermal Interface Materials\nEvaluation and selection of high-performance TIMs achieving thermal conductivity > 5 W/mK with minimal bond line thickness.\n\n## Manufacturing\n\nThe cold plates were manufactured using selective laser melting (SLM) allowing complex internal geometries impossible with conventional machining. This additive manufacturing approach enabled:\n- Conformal cooling channels\n- Integrated manifolds\n- Reduced assembly complexity",
