  Revolutionizing Medical Data Generation with SynLLM   

In a groundbreaking development, researchers have unveiled SynLLM - a framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-quality synthetic medical tabular data.

## The Challenge: Restricted Access to Medical Data

Access to real-world medical data is often limited due to privacy regulations, hindering the advancement of healthcare research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but generating realistic and clinically valid records remains challenging.

## Introducing SynLLM: A Modular Framework

SynLLM employs 20 state-of-the-art LLMs to generate synthetic medical tabular data through structured prompts. Four distinct prompt types, ranging from example-driven to rule-based constraints, encode schema, metadata, and domain knowledge without the need for model fine-tuning.

## Evaluating SynLLM: Comprehensive Assessment Pipeline

SynLLM features a rigorous evaluation pipeline that assesses generated data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy preservation. The framework was tested on three public medical datasets using 20 open-source LLMs.
