## Introduction

Welcome to our in-depth guide on Discrete Element Modeling (DEM), a pivotal simulation technique that has revolutionized the study and engineering of particulate systems. In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of DEM, its significant milestones, and its applications across various sectors. Additionally, we will look into the technological advancements that are shaping its future.

## What is Discrete Element Modeling (DEM)?

Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) is a numerical simulation technique for predicting the behavior of assemblies of particles. By treating each particle as a separate entity, DEM allows detailed analysis of their mechanical behavior under various conditions. This approach is especially beneficial for understanding systems where particle interactions are critical, such as in granular flow, powder mixing, and soil mechanics.

## Historical Evolution of DEM

DEM was first conceptualized in the late 1970s and has evolved significantly. Initially designed to simulate rock mechanics, it now supports complex three-dimensional simulations across various industries. This section could include a timeline graphic detailing key developments in DEM technology.

## Core Mechanics of DEM

### Particle Properties

Each particle's size, shape, density, and material properties are defined to suit the simulation's requirements.

### Contact Detection

DEM continuously checks for contacts between particles and between particles and boundaries.

### Force Calculations

It calculates forces due to contacts, including normal and tangential components, using various contact models.

### Motion Equations

The motion of each particle is updated according to Newton's second law, considering all acting forces.
