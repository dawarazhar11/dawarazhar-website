Work from home just got a whole lot healthier with the introduction of under-desk treadmills. These compact workout machines are revolutionizing the way we approach our daily grind, allowing us to burn calories while tackling our to-do lists.

Measuring roughly the size of a yoga mat, these petite pads fit seamlessly under standing desks, providing a discreet and quiet way to keep moving throughout the day. Plus, many models fold up for easy storage when not in use.

Personal trainer Dion Oliver, 38, who is studying to become a physical therapist in New York, swears by his under-desk treadmill. "I can knock out those quick email responses while walking at a brisk pace, easily hitting 8,000 steps," he said.

Dr. Lance Einerson, a physical therapist in Boise, Idaho, also incorporates his walking pad into his daily routine, using it for "autopilot work." Despite his rigorous exercise regimen, which includes weight training and jiu-jitsu, he finds that the extra steps on his treadmill lead to better sleep at night.

Software engineer Ben Kogan, 31, from New York City, purchased his pad last summer and uses it four to five days a week for sessions lasting anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes. He walks while taking calls, responding to emails, and handling personal administrative tasks. As an added bonus, he's noticed an increased appetite, allowing him to consume more food to support his muscle-building goals.

## The devices let you walk, even jog, while you’re sending quick messages and trying to stay awake through dreary video meetings.
